At the beginning of this course, you were provided with some initial resources that you modified in the subsequent lessons.  If you encountered any problems you can compare your changes to the expected result.  The expected project is available to download at the link provided below.

After doing your comparison, you may want to delete your modified project folder, this downloaded and unpacked folder, and both packed downloads.  You can do that with your favorite file manager or at the command line with your operating system's terminal.

At the beginning of this course, you were provided with some resources.  Now is the time to delete and clean it up.  You can do that with your favorite file manager or at the command line with your operating system's terminal.  It is safe to just delete the downloaded file and its unpacked folder.

At the beginning of this course, you downloaded and started up a Docker environment using Docker Compose.  Now is the time to stop and delete those containers.

```shell
docker-compose down
docker-compose stop
```

Optionally, you can delete the downloaded resources too.  You can do that with your favorite file manager or at the command line with your operating system's terminal.  You may choose to keep it to revisit the environment later on your time.
