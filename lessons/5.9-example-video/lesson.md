A precursor of text to describe the video embedded below.  Set some expectations.

It is recommended that you embed the video using the [flexmark Media Tags Extension](https://github.com/vsch/flexmark-java/wiki/Extensions#media-tags).  An example is provided below.  You will see that it is nearly identical to how you embed images.  Unfortunately this is not available in most IDEs.

!V[Video is not supported or found](http://techslides.com/demos/sample-videos/small.mp4)

You could also just use the appropriate HTML5 markup.

<video width="100%" controls>
        <source src="http://techslides.com/demos/sample-videos/small.mp4" />
        Your browser does not suppor the video tag
</video>

It is up to you whether to include text after the video.  You risk having the student read the text while watching the video, which probably means they are not paying proper attention to the video.  You are probably best off moving them to the next lesson.
